# Zoltar

Zoltar was my quick "relieve my boredom" on a train while going
home to see my parents. It just reads in a list of the BSD "%" separated
quotes that I found when I installed fortune and turns it into an
API.

I'm probably going to add more to this and possibly try to turn it into
some kind of api to get a markov chain of the fortunes. 

Regardless, it's silly and kinda fun.

## Running Zoltar
It's pretty easy. Just run `rackup config.ru` or `ruby zoltar.rb`

I've only tested it with ruby 2.0, so buyer beware.
