# Zoltar

Zoltar was my quick "relieve my boredom" on a train while going
home to see my parents. It just reads in a list of the BSD "%" separated
quotes that I found when I installed fortune and turns it into an
API.

I'm probably going to add more to this and possibly try to turn it into
some kind of api to get a markov chain of the fortunes. 

Regardless, it's silly and kinda fun.
